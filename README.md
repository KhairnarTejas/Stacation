'Stacation' or 'Wanderlust' is a comprehensive travel planning web application designed and implemented as part of my exploration in Full Stack Web Development. The application provides users with the ability to discover and plan their travel experiences. Key features include browsing and creating travel listings, user authentication, and the integration of location-based services.
